I have always been a big advocate of Massive open online courses(MOOC). Over the years I have completed MOOCs related mostly but not limited to Computer Science. This page is a collection of my MOOC certificates and selected MOOC assignments. My sincere gratitude to all the MOOC platforms specially to Coursera who have made education available and enjoyable.
